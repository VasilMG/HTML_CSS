properties for child elements in flex

 ** order - orders a different element in a specific position

.box {
    order: 2
}

.box:nth-child(3) {
    order: 1;
}
this will send the 3rd elemen to the first place of the ordering 
because all other items have ordering 2

if the other items do not have ordering the 3rd element will go to the end


** flex-grow: number(1, 2, 3) - allows the item to grow to fill free space, 0 - dont grow

** flex-shrink - opposite ot flex grow
the items will shrink if we make the browse window smaller

** flex-basis: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword (auto, content)

** we ca use just flex: 2 1 auto; which means:
.item {
    flex: (default)none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ];

** align-self { property } - can align only one item seperately from the others
